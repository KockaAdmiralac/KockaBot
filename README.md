# KockaBot
[Discord](https://discordapp.com) bot developed in [Python](https://python.org) using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

This was a Discord bot made for my personal use. It may still work, but I've switched to using a [Twinkle](https://github.com/Dorumin/Twinkle)-based solution and will not maintain this further.
